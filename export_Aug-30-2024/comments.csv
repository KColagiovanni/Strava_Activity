"Jun 22, 2012, 7:43:37 PM","It was pretty beastly, but i went slow, lower hr when possible, to see if it would help me last longer, and I didn't feel dead after, so i think it helped."

"Aug 3, 2012, 3:04:21 PM","ayyy, you have plantar fasciitis, your not supposed to be running dud, your gonna get injured, then you wont be able to run at all, or worse you might permanently injured."
"Aug 3, 2012, 3:05:49 PM","You need to handle it, by stretching and let it resting it, then when it's healed get back into running, but you should always stretch your foot, even when it feels better
"

"
"Aug 10, 2012, 9:07:56 PM","Those are some nice PR's
"
"Aug 10, 2012, 9:08:34 PM","I like how you got the Pagemill decent PR and we were stuck behind those cars
"
"Aug 10, 2012, 10:07:18 PM","Room for improvment . . .
"
"Aug 18, 2012, 2:50:28 PM","I did break 3 minutes on Blk Mtn, I think you mean Elena, and yeah, we gotta hit that shit up."

"
"Oct 1, 2012, 12:00:56 AM","Not too bad, just a little of each here and there. The leg workout i did prior was harder. Oh yeah and i stole my other two KOM's back :-p"
"Oct 4, 2012, 5:23:03 PM",Well ascent and descent ;-D
"Oct 7, 2012, 7:16:08 AM","Thx, wish you were there ;-)

"
"Oct 12, 2012, 11:31:35 PM",U killen em!
"Oct 21, 2012, 3:12:19 PM","Damn man, you went up that thing fast, right on! Did you buy a road bike or what?"
"Oct 22, 2012, 3:50:50 PM","Yeah, a couple times, but haven't for a while. They're usually pretty competitive. Tim and I got dropped off the back a few times, but I also was able to stay with them a couple times. I think depending on who is there determines how fast they go. They meet in the parking lot around building 4 at 11:25ish and depart at 11:30. If they do the standard loop they return around 12:45, again depending on their pace. Sometimes they'll climb old la honda up to skyline, then go down skyline to 84, descend that and continue on the standard loop. that ads almost an extra 45 minutes. You can take shorter routes too, to get back sooner. When Tim and I used to go we would take a shorter route cause we couldn't take as long of a lunch. 

This is ""the loop"": http://app.strava.com/activities/1159006

This is the shorter loop: http://app.strava.com/activities/1091470

This is the loop plus OLH(old la honda): http://app.strava.com/activities/23895451

"Oct 31, 2012, 12:38:12 AM","so it's not me that makes you fall, its you ehh?"
"Oct 31, 2012, 3:18:51 PM",Sure
"Nov 1, 2012, 2:41:23 PM","You made your GPS go crazy. Nice ride. Did you use a light, or moonlight only?"
"Nov 2, 2012, 6:32:54 PM","An update could help, but you can also change the rate at which your gps signal samples, i think the default setting is 5 or 10 seconds, but i changed mine to 1 second, that also uses more battery, but i've never been below probably 80% after any ride. Which didn't seem to make too much of a difference. My edge 500 used to get weird sometimes with speed display, but lately it's been pretty good, so i guess that could be due to updates. "
"Nov 3, 2012, 10:39:31 PM",That is a third of your ride? So you rode over 100 miles?
"Nov 3, 2012, 10:40:19 PM","That's not where you live, you still have about 0 more miles to go.
"
"Nov 5, 2012, 3:34:09 AM",Nice ride.
"Nov 5, 2012, 3:29:44 PM","Yeah it is. That was my first time on Mt Eden Rd, it was a nice quiet road."
"Nov 7, 2012, 4:02:24 PM","Yeah, it didn't feel like it was that fast until the truck started braking and I had to pull out to the side into the full wind."
"Nov 9, 2012, 3:32:23 PM","I really rode it, i swear
"
"Nov 9, 2012, 10:41:44 PM",Whatcha practicing for?
"Nov 9, 2012, 10:44:36 PM","Looks like you were doing intervals, at least at first.

"Nov 9, 2012, 10:55:53 PM",Sure you were . . . looks like someone needs a rear wheel speed sensor.
"Nov 11, 2012, 10:04:04 PM","I stayed in bed the rest of the day, lol."
"Nov 12, 2012, 3:38:52 PM",I don't see any proof!

"
"Nov 15, 2012, 9:36:15 PM","Phantom, ehh"
"Nov 16, 2012, 4:00:05 PM","Nice ride, finally made it up to Skyline.  Sucks your GPS signal drifted, it didn't put you in a Hwy 9 Ascent segment, did you change your GPS to 1 second recording instead of smart recording? Page Mill descent is always fun, just don't tell Tim, he doesn't find any fun in it."
"Nov 16, 2012, 4:37:42 PM","""Dekauffing"" means we're taking a much needed get away from the kauff"
"Nov 16, 2012, 5:05:28 PM","I just realized that we barely missed each other, I was mtn biking up there at the gap (Hwy 9/Skyline intersection). Maybe saw you coming up as I was driving down 9, or vice versa, remember seeing a gold s10 w/ 2 mtn bikes in the back coming down 9
?"
"Nov 16, 2012, 7:47:16 PM","It's really fun, but also another thing not to ask Tim about. lol"
"Nov 16, 2012, 10:42:08 PM","Sorry Tim, but you're missing out on some of the best things cycling has to offer ;-)"
"Nov 18, 2012, 5:24:38 PM",It was steep!
"Nov 18, 2012, 5:25:14 PM",. . . and a half marathon ;-)
"Nov 22, 2012, 5:33:48 AM",Did you guys use your new watches together? lol.
"Nov 22, 2012, 5:34:40 AM","Looks like the watch makes you faster too, nice upgrade, must have added at least 5 horsepower."
"Nov 27, 2012, 10:22:42 PM",You should make a segment for that Fassler climb.
"Dec 2, 2012, 2:02:26 PM",Its actually the Crestview climb that was a bitch. 
"Dec 3, 2012, 5:36:10 PM",You're getting into Cyclocross now?
"Dec 3, 2012, 9:24:40 PM","you gonna ride it or just watch?
"
"Dec 4, 2012, 3:34:07 PM",With your road bike?
"Dec 4, 2012, 10:23:17 PM","Nice, sounds fun.
"
"Dec 6, 2012, 3:35:04 PM","You had to get the Dub edition, didn't you? I don't see this happening if your car wasn't so gangsta.
"
"Dec 10, 2012, 4:40:47 PM",Strava vs Garmin is always different. Garmin just wants everyone to like them more.
"Dec 16, 2012, 4:28:20 AM","Sry, Timbo, I messed up the edit on the original ride. and deleted it  I had to reload  the ride. "
"Dec 16, 2012, 5:25:07 AM","Oh yeah, and I think i'll be ready for the Varian to the sea and back ride. You down to do it in the rain?"
"Dec 16, 2012, 5:26:51 AM","http://www.weather.com/weather/tenday/Palo+Alto+CA+USCA0830:1:US, just sayin, it could happen."
"Dec 16, 2012, 6:53:51 AM","Some bruises on my right shoulder, and some impact bruises and a piercing on my left calf. "
"Dec 17, 2012, 3:30:36 PM","The bike did go down with me, but I wasn't clipped in by the time i stopped moving. My SPD cleats unclip a lot easier than the SPD-SL, so it's usually not an issue."
"Jan 10, 2013, 3:44:12 PM",:-(
"Jan 15, 2013, 3:48:17 PM",Hi. My toes we numb from the cold about half way through thanks to the 50 degree avg temp

"Feb 5, 2013, 4:40:47 PM","The Gym is the other way, lol. How's the foot feelin?"
"Feb 5, 2013, 4:57:59 PM","I cant' help it, i'm on a special training plan"
"Feb 5, 2013, 10:25:50 PM","Did you see the white bike locked to a sign on paseo? A biker died there a few weeks ago, got hit by a car, crazy."
"Feb 6, 2013, 4:06:53 PM",I'm working on it
"Feb 10, 2013, 10:09:21 PM",and how did that go? Did you pass your test?
"Feb 11, 2013, 3:22:50 PM",For a little bit
"Feb 12, 2013, 4:31:42 PM",Damn!

"Feb 15, 2013, 3:39:27 PM","Uh oh, someone is getting hooked"
"Feb 15, 2013, 8:41:20 PM","Haha, don't tell Tim that."

"Feb 21, 2013, 4:09:14 PM","Early half day, lol"
"Feb 21, 2013, 4:10:00 PM",How much air did you have to put into the tires?
"Feb 22, 2013, 3:53:24 AM","Oh, then why'd you put the sixy beast, so you can add more strava miles to the odometer, lol"
"Feb 27, 2013, 3:47:59 PM","Uh oh, no more LHRT"
"Feb 27, 2013, 6:44:17 PM",Which one? ohhhhhh
"Mar 5, 2013, 4:04:45 PM",What's that I hear? It sounds like an injury is coming.

"Mar 17, 2013, 6:00:12 AM","I was wondering how I beat you on all the segments, but I see now you havent changed it to hike, or maybe you'll keep it on run, imma keep it on hike :-p

"Jun 26, 2013, 4:28:19 PM",Lol. Wut? Tim turning down the intensity? I thought you would never learn ;-)
"Jun 26, 2013, 5:43:28 PM",Haha true!

"
"Feb 6, 2014, 10:31:07 PM",Cause I'm not on the Tim level and you're guaranteed to push me more than I want to be pushed. 
"Feb 6, 2014, 11:05:47 PM",i'm surprised you didn't catch me on the way out.
"Feb 12, 2014, 8:59:08 PM","I think so, haha."

Also i'm not sure if it's always been open, but the skyline trail that parallels Skyline road is open to bikers and it pretty fun and a little technical in places and goes all the way to The Gap parking lot. I say its worth checking out."

"Nov 4, 2015, 2:06:11 AM","Haha, I love it when that happens."
"Nov 5, 2015, 3:01:06 PM","Looks like you're stalking someone, just sayin . . ."

"Nov 17, 2015, 7:33:00 PM","Nice ride! I've heard rangers are cracking down on people riding mailboxes, just a heads up."

"Nov 23, 2015, 6:55:03 PM",Nice route 
"Nov 25, 2015, 5:13:58 AM",Nice! That's a lot of pavement for a mountain bike. Looks like you might need a cx bike now.

"Nov 27, 2015, 7:28:30 PM","Haha, buzzed downhill sounds even more fun than non buzzed downhill. How was it? I've always been curious about going up there. "
"Nov 30, 2015, 7:06:12 AM",How are you liking the new bike?
"Dec 9, 2015, 3:48:12 AM",Now that's a loop! What was the mission?
"Dec 10, 2015, 4:31:19 AM",There you go. Better than just going to the stupid rock. 
"Dec 10, 2015, 8:15:51 PM",How was this place? I've never been and haven't heard much about it. 
"Dec 10, 2015, 8:27:43 PM","Nice, What's the downhill like?"
"Dec 10, 2015, 11:50:37 PM",Nice. Going for the 13.1?
"Dec 15, 2015, 3:11:29 PM",Nice warm up!
"Dec 17, 2015, 4:02:55 PM","How was the downhill? I've always been curious, but only been there during the day and haven't wanted to risk it."
"Dec 18, 2015, 4:22:55 AM",Nice. Was it all fire road?
"Jan 21, 2016, 7:43:00 PM",Is this your one and only ride of the year?

"Feb 8, 2016, 3:49:39 AM",Nice! And ouch at the same time. 
"Feb 8, 2016, 3:50:12 AM",Nice! You just needed a few practice runs.

"Apr 2, 2016, 3:57:45 PM","Yeah, once you get up to the top it's pretty cool, esp this time of year when it's way more green. "
"Apr 3, 2016, 3:42:23 PM","Nice, that's pretty super!"
"Apr 6, 2016, 11:26:37 PM",Creek trail King!

"May 31, 2016, 4:02:34 AM",What?!? Tim on two wheels?? Say it ain't so. 
"Jun 4, 2016, 2:54:22 PM","Haha, probably cause the wheels are old. I used to wear my wheels down to the plastic hub, but sometimes they would just fall apart first. I got a new set of wheels and bearings less than a year ago off Amazon, they have some good deals. "

"Jun 5, 2016, 6:12:37 AM","I'm just giving you a hard time. That's a really long ride in the saddle, especially on a mountain bike, and with that much climbing. Props to you for making it that far, I doubt I could have. I would like to check it out sometime. Hope you enjoyed it. "
"Jun 6, 2016, 12:51:14 PM",We're starting to get back into it. Haven't seen Todd out there for a while tho :-(

"Jun 13, 2016, 7:34:21 PM",Straight bitch mode
"Jun 13, 2016, 8:07:13 PM",That's why I'm here. 
"Jul 5, 2016, 4:31:51 PM",Hell yeah. Out of nowhere strava post. Almost thought you were dead.

"Jan 25, 2017, 10:15:00 PM","There was powder everywhere, it was awesome. "
"Feb 9, 2017, 2:32:32 PM","That sucks, I took a hard fall last time I went snowboard, luckily nothing broke.  "
"Mar 16, 2017, 5:19:26 AM",Nice ride! How's the condition of Stevens canyon?
"Apr 29, 2017, 5:10:25 PM",Beast!!! Did you have to stand in line to take a pole pic?
"Oct 15, 2017, 4:57:37 AM","Hey Richard, I hope you’re doing well. Last I remember you were living out in the north bay, I hope you and your family are safe and doing well with all the fires up there. "

"Sep 13, 2020, 7:58:03 PM",Nice to meet you Kyle. I forgot to mention Cañada Rd in woodside is a pretty flat road and also good for sprints and TTing. 
"Sep 22, 2020, 3:42:28 AM","Thanks. The high point is close to the top of Montebello Rd, it’s down the fire road I pointed out to you. "
